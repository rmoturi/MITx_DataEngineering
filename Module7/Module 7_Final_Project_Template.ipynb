    "In Video 7.9, Dr. Williams presented you with an example of data analysis in which housing prices were predicted by using just the columns `OverallQual` and `MassVnrArea` from the data provided. In Video 7.10, Dr. Williams showed more examples of data visualization and manipulation in addition to a more detailed analysis of the data.\n",

Although in Video 7.10 you are offered a sample data analysis which uses five columns from the data provided, your project submission must include an analysis of at least three additional variables and offer other solutions that improve the results obtained by Dr. Williams in these two videos.\n",
